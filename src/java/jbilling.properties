# Process time configuration
# These two properties set the frequency of the jbilling batch process
# The fist property indicates at what time of the day the trigger has to 
# happen for the very first time. After this first run you will need X minutes 
# (specified by 'process.frequency') to run the trigger again.
# The first property is optional. If it is not present, then the next trigger will happen at 
# startup + minutes indicated in 'process.frequency'.
#   time: YYYYMMDD-HHmm (a full date followed by HH is the hours in 24hs format and mm the minutes).
